Breast Cancer Risk Prediction
Using Predictive Analysis To Predict Diagnosis of a Tumor


Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women, accounting for nearly 1 in 3 cancers diagnosed among women in the United States, and it is the second leading cause of cancer death among women. Breast Cancer occurs as a results of abnormal growth of cells in the breast tissue, commonly referred to as a Tumor. A tumor does not mean cancer - tumors can be benign (not cancerous), pre-malignant (pre-cancerous), or malignant (cancerous). Tests such as MRI, mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy are commonly used to diagnose breast cancer performed.


The early diagnosis of breast cancer can improve the prognosis and chance of survival significantly, as it can promote timely clinical treatment to patients. Further accurate classification of benign tumors can prevent patients undergoing unnecessary treatments. Thus, the correct diagnosis of breast cancer and classification of patients into malignant or benign groups is the subject of much research. Because of its unique advantages in critical features detection from complex breast cancer datasets, machine learning (ML) is widely recognized as the methodology of choice in breast cancer pattern classification and forecast modeling. Some risk factor for breast cancer is age, personal or family history and genetics. However, most cases cannot be linked to specific cause.
